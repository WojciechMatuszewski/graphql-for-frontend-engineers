We will cover:

- `query` operation

## Prerequisites

You will need a couple of things installed on your local machine:

* Node.Js 12+

To get the most out of this workshop you should be comfortable with `Typescript` and `React`.

## Validation and setup

To make sure everything is set up

1. Make sure _Docker_ is running on your machine

2. Run the validation script

```sh
make validate
```

## Starting the app

**After validation is successful** please run:

```sh
make start
```

The application is available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Playground

Playground is there for you to explore the schema and operations that you can do. Whenever you are lost, not sure how to
define given operation, this is the place where you should look into (apart from asking me ðŸ™‚).

The playground is available at [http://localhost:4000/playground](http://localhost:4000/playground).
Before going there, **make sure you started the application**.
