# Setting up Apollo Client

## What is `Apollo Client`

`Apollo Client` is the THING that will provide all abstractions needed to work with `GraphQL` API.

It provides a rich ecosystem of tools, has great support and tons of people are using it in production.

## History
We will be using version 3 of the package.
This version greatly simplifies dependency management since you only need two things to make everything work (baseline):

- `Apollo Client` itself
- the `graphql` package 

This did not use to be the case, so we are in luck now that the `Apollo Client` team decided to go this route ðŸ˜Š

## Exercise

The goal of this exercise is to get you familiar with the basic concepts of `Apollo Client`.

Go ahead and install the client and `graphql` package if you have not yet already. 

```shell script
npm install @apollo/client graphql
```

Then, initialize it with all the necessary constructs like `HttpLink` and `Cache`.
Use [the documentation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/v3.0-beta/get-started/) if you need any help â€” it is well written and helpful.

## Extra credit

### ðŸ’¯ Create a `Provider` component

As like many `React` libraries, `Apollo Client` uses `React.Context` under the hood, thus it provides `ApolloProvider` component.

This is great, but usually we want to encapsulate concerns (in this case creating the `ApolloProvider` itself) in a separate file.

See if you can figure a way of doing so.
