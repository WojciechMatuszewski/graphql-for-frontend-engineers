# Authrozation

Previous exercises involved `mutations` and `queries` but we never worried about
any aspect of `authorization`.

`Apollo Client` operates on the notion of `links`. You can think of those links
as `middlewares` or `afterwares` that modify the request that you make.

Using those `middlewares` we can make sure that with each request, an `Authorization`
header is set.
